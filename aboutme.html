        <h2>My Journey through Whitehat</h2>
        <p>My journey through Whitehat jr. has been very great and filled with wonders.I learned a lot about coding, creating games and fixing errors in the games. I learned how to style my own webpage and give proper links to all of my projects I have created so far. Lastly, I want to thank my teacher and the whitehat jr. community for giving me this oppurtunity to create my own games and publish it on playstore.</p>
        <h2>My achievements</h2>
        <p>I participated in a school debate on the topic "Fundamental India" and bagged a third position.
           I got selected for the inter-school football team and helped our School team reach the semi-finals of the tournament.
           I recieved 5 "Champion" badges from Whitehat jr. for staying in the top 3 on the leaderboard.
        </p>
        <h2>Places I would Like to visit</h2>
        <p>There are many places that I have visited till now. But, only a few of them surprised me with teir beauty and pleasant environment.
           Places like Sikkim, that is a hill-station known for its high-field tea production, has a really pleasant weather and its tea is the experience of a lifetime.
           Shimla and Manali are also places that have their own beautiful nature and attract a large group of visitors including foreigners.
